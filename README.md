## Project Overview
This project focuses on improving the usability and accessibility of the ConnectionIT website. It's a platform that aggregates cutting-edge technology solutions for global organizations of all sizes.

Through observation and accessibility evaluations, I identified key areas for improvement and created a detailed redesign to enhance the user experience.

## Challenges
- Enhance accessibility to ensure a more inclusive experience.

- Identify usability issues through direct observation of real users.

- Create a **Hi-Fidelity** redesign that prioritizes usability and readability.

## Spotted Accessibility Issues
After observing Rose, a user navigating the ConnectionIT website, I identified several accessibility concerns:

- **Tab Navigation Issues:** The website lacks proper keyboard tabbing, making it difficult for users to navigate via keyboard.

- **Card Components Accessibility:** Several accessibility issues were present, such as improper alt-text and inconsistent structure.

- **Heading Structure:** Heading elements were not arranged in a descending order, impacting screen reader navigation.

- **Typography Contrast & Size:** The text contrast and size were insufficient, particularly in the card components, making content hard to read.

## Prioritization
I prioritized enhancing the readability and accessibility of the card components first, as they play a crucial role in user engagement and product discovery.

## Detailed Sketch
Once I identified the major accessibility issues, I sketched various redesign concepts to explore potential solutions. After evaluating multiple options, I selected the most effective layout and refined it into a more detailed version.

## Hi-Fidelity Design
To bring my design concept to life, I created a **Hi-Fidelity** card prototype using Figma. This version incorporates accessibility improvements such as:

- Improved text contrast and legibility.

- Properly structured headings for better screen reader compatibility.

- Enhanced tab navigation for seamless keyboard accessibility.

## Key Takeaways
Throughout this design sprint, I gained valuable insights into web accessibility, including:

- Recognizing the importance of **keyboard accessibility** for navigation.

- Utilizing **AI-driven accessibility evaluation tools** to identify and resolve web accessibility issues.

- Applying **professional UI/UX practices** to promote inclusivity in digital experiences.

## Room for Improvement
- **Further Accessibility Testing:** Additional evaluations to uncover any remaining accessibility gaps.

- **Hi-Fidelity Prototype Testing:** Testing the revised prototype with real users will provide deeper insights into usability improvements.

- **Advanced Accessibility Evaluations:** Refine my expertise in web accessibility and inclusion assessments to enhance future projects.
